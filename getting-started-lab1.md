# Azure OpenAI + NLP using ChatGPT on SQL Engine

### Overall Estimated Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes

## Overview

In this lab, you will explore an application that integrates Azure OpenAI's ChatGPT with advanced data analytics to provide in-depth business insights. The application leverages AI to uncover emerging trends, analyze customer behaviors, and forecast future outcomes, enabling businesses to make informed, strategic decisions based on comprehensive data analysis. You will learn how to utilize Azure App Services for scalable and reliable application hosting and Azure OpenAI for cutting-edge natural language processing. This lab will guide you through transforming complex data into actionable intelligence, enhancing your understanding and operational efficiency.

## Objective

Understand how to set up OpenAI in Azure, deploy it to Azure App Service, and leverage AI-driven tools for effective data analysis and SQL query generation. By the end of this lab, participants will be able to : 

- **Open AI Setup and Installation of Application** : Learn to review and configure an OpenAI resource in Azure, followed by deploying an application to Azure App Service using the command-line interface. This exercise will cover setting up the resource, ensuring its proper integration, and successfully hosting the application in the cloud.
- **Quick Start With Hosted Demo Application** : Learn to interact with the hosted Demo Application, utilizing the Data Analysis Assistant and SQL Query Writing Assistant. This exercise focuses on analyzing data and leveraging AI tools to streamline data analysis and query generation.

## Pre-requisites

Participants should have the following prerequisites:

- **Fundamental Knowledge of Azure Services** : Knowing about some of the basic services like App Services.
- **Basic Understanding Programming Language** : basic understanding of programming languages like python or csharp.

## Architecture

In this hands-on lab, you will deploy a Python or C# web application to Azure App Services via the CLI and integrate it with an Azure OpenAI resource. The application features two tools: the Data Analysis Assistant, which uses AI to uncover insights and trends from data, and the SQL Query Writing Assistant, which helps users generate and optimize SQL queries from natural language inputs. You will configure the application to handle user requests, leveraging Azure OpenAI to deliver intelligent, data-driven responses and query support.
